# DiseasePrediction
In this project we implement 3 classification algrorithms namely - support vector machine , random forest and naive bayes to predict the
disease user may have based on the sympotms provided 

<p>we have downloaded the dataset from kaggle which consists of 41 disease and their respective symptoms </p>
<p>we load the data in jupyter notebook and then implement these algortihms</p>
after training our model we dump it using pickle library and then use it again in a web application made via streamlit
