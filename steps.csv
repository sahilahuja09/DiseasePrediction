Disease,Steps
Fungal infection,"Most fungal skin infections can be treated with over-the-counter or prescription creams. Severe infections may require additional methods. Anti - Fungal Medication: clotrimazole (Canesten), econazole, miconazole, terbinafine (Lamisil), fluconazole (Diflucan), ketoconazole (Daktarin), nystatin (Nystan), amphotericin"
Allergy,"Antihistamines have been used for years to treat allergy symptoms. They can be taken as pills, liquid, nasal spray, or eye drops. Cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), levocetirizine (Xyzal), and loratadine (Alavert, Claritin) are taken by mouth whereas Ketotifen (Zaditor) and naphazoline and pheniramine combination ophthalmic (OcuHist) are eye drops."
GERD,"Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC)."
Chronic cholestasis,"Mild pruritus can often be managed by nonspecific measures such as emollients and warm baths and/or histamine 1-receptor blockers such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine due to their sedative properties. However, it would be a better option to consult a doctor for appropriately prescribed medication."
Drug Reaction,"Call 911 or emergency medical help if you experience signs of a severe reaction or suspected anaphylaxis after taking a medication. If you have milder symptoms of a drug allergy, see your doctor as soon as possible."
Peptic ulcer diseae,"These drugs include the prescription and over-the-counter medications omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium) and pantoprazole (Protonix)."
AIDS,"The treatment of HIV/AIDS with medicines is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is recommended for everyone who has HIV. The medicines do not cure HIV infection, but they do make it a manageable chronic condition. They also reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others."
Diabetes ,"If you're diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor or health care provider may do other tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes — since the two conditions often require different treatments."
Gastroenteritis,"In some cases, adults can take over-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) to treat diarrhea caused by viral gastroenteritis. If you have bloody diarrhea or fever—signs of infections with bacteria or parasites—don’t use over-the-counter medicines to treat diarrhea. See a doctor for treatment."
Bronchial Asthma,"Short-acting beta-agonists are the first choice for quick relief of asthma symptoms. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), epinephrine (Asthmanefrin, Primatene Mist), and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA). Anticholinergics such as ipratropium (Atrovent) lessen mucus in addition to opening your airways. They take longer to work than short-acting beta-agonists. Oral corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone ands prednisone lower swelling in your airways. Combination quick-relief medicines have both an anticholinergic and a short-acting beta-agonist."
Hypertension ,"For most people, the first-choice medication for high blood pressure is a thiazide diuretic. For other people, a diuretic alone is not enough to control blood pressure. In these cases, a diuretic may be combined with a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker."
Migraine,"These over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers include aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). Migraine relief medications that combine caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen (Excedrin Migraine) may be helpful, but usually only against mild migraine pain."

Antidepressants"
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"A doctor will examine you immediately if any type of brain hemorrhage is suspected.

These imaging tests determine the location, extent and sometimes the cause of the bleed."
Jaundice,"Jaundice usually doesn't require treatment in adults (it's a more severe problem in infants). The causes and complications of jaundice can be treated. For instance, if itching is bothersome, it may be eased by cholestyramine (Questran®). In cases of intentional or unintentional acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, the antidote N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) may be required."
Malaria,"The most common antimalarial drugs include Chloroquine phosphate and Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Examples of ACTs include artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) and artesunate-mefloquine.
Other common antimalarial drugs include: Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone), Quinine sulfate (Qualaquin) with doxycycline (Oracea, Vibramycin, others), Primaquine phosphate etc."
Chicken pox,"If you’ve been exposed to someone who has chickenpox but doesn’t have symptoms yet, your doctor may give you an injection of a treatment called immunoglobulin.

In most cases of hepatitis A, the liver heals within six months with no lasting damage. Hepatitis A treatment usually focuses on keeping comfortable and controlling signs and symptoms."
Hepatitis B,"Treatment for chronic hepatitis B may include: Antiviral medications. Several antiviral medications — including entecavir (Baraclude), tenofovir (Viread), lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera) and telbivudine (Tyzeka) — can help fight the virus and slow its ability to damage your liver."
Hepatitis C,Hepatitis C is treated using direct-acting antiviral (DAA) tablets. DAA tablets are the safest and most effective medicines for treating hepatitis C. They're highly effective at clearing the infection in more than 90% of people. The tablets are taken for 8 to 12 weeks.
Hepatitis D,"There are no known treatments for acute or chronic hepatitis D. Unlike other forms of hepatitis, current antiviral medications don't seem to be very effective in treating HDV. You may be given large doses of a medication called interferon for up to 12 months."
Hepatitis E,"There is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. Most important is the avoidance of unnecessary medications."
